tinyCMS
=======

Perhaps the worlds tiniest CMS system. If you want a lightweight, small, tiny CMS system that is under 20k, then you are at the right place.

Built in PHP and using flat text files to store page data, you simply upload the files on to your webserver and you are away.

You then edit the admin/config.php to customise.

#To Do
Add CSS options and themes
